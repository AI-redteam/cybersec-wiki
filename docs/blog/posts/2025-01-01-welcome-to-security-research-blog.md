## Our Focus Areas

### AI/ML Security
With the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning systems, new attack surfaces are emerging. We'll explore:

- **Adversarial Machine Learning**: Techniques for manipulating ML models through carefully crafted inputs
- **Prompt Injection Attacks**: Breaking LLM security boundaries through creative prompting
- **Model Extraction & Privacy**: Understanding how attackers can steal proprietary models
- **AI Red Teaming**: Systematic approaches to testing AI system security

### Cloud Security Research

Cloud platforms have become the backbone of modern infrastructure, making cloud security research critical:

- **IAM Exploitation**: Privilege escalation and access control bypass techniques
- **Serverless Security**: Unique attack vectors in function-as-a-service environments
- **Container Escape**: Breaking out of containerized environments
- **Cloud Misconfigurations**: Common security pitfalls and detection methods

### Vulnerability Research

Deep technical analysis of security vulnerabilities across platforms:

- CVE analysis and exploitation
- Zero-day discovery methodologies
- Responsible disclosure practices
- Exploit development techniques

### Red Team Operations

Practical offensive security techniques and methodologies:

- Initial access tactics
- Lateral movement strategies
- Persistence mechanisms
- Defense evasion techniques

## What to Expect

Posts on this blog will include:

- **Technical Deep Dives**: Detailed analysis with code examples and proof-of-concepts
- **Tool Releases**: Custom security tools and automation frameworks
- **Research Findings**: Novel vulnerabilities and attack techniques
- **Practical Guides**: Step-by-step tutorials for security assessment
- **Threat Analysis**: Real-world attack pattern analysis

## Publishing Schedule

New posts will be published regularly covering the latest security research, emerging threats, and practical defensive strategies. Each post is designed to provide actionable insights that security professionals can apply in their work.

## How to Write a New Blog Post

To add a new blog post to this site:
